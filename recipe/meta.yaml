  description: |
    Barnaba is a tool for analyzing RNA three-dimensional structures and simulations.
    Barnaba uses MDtraj to read/write topology and trajectory files, as such it supports
    several formats including pdb, xtc, trr, dcd, binpos, netcdf, mdcrd, prmtop, and more.
    Barnaba has been developed by Sandro Bottaro with the crucial help of Giovanni Bussi, Giovanni Pinamonti,
    Sabine Rei{\ss}er and Wouter Boomsma.
